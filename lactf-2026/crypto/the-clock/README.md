# The Clock

## Summary

Challenge description: Don't run out of time

The challenge implements a Diffie–Hellman–style key exchange over a vulnerable custom algebraic group, followed by AES-ECB symmetric encryption of the flag. Due to the algebraic group chosen, an attacker can easily recover the prime $p$ and also brute-force compute either of Alice or Bob's secrets in order to decrypt the flag.

**Artifacts:**

- `chall.py`: implementation of vulnerable encryption scheme, chosen prime $p$ is redacted
- `solve.py`: python script to solve the challenge
- `output.txt`: output generated by `chall.py`
- `challenge.yaml`: challenge metadata file, including flag

## Context

The challenge author *freed* provides the [source code](./chall.py) of the key exchange, with the (typically public) modulus prime $p$ redatected, as well as an [output](./output.txt) containing Alice and Bob's public keys and the encrypted flag produced by the source code.

Initially, the key exchange seems to possibly be ECDH, because an addition and scalar multiplication operation are defined over a field reminiscent of elliptic-curve cryptography.

```python
def clockadd(P1,P2):
  x1,y1 = P1
  x2,y2 = P2
  x3 = x1*y2+y1*x2
  y3 = y1*y2-x1*x2
  return x3,y3
```
